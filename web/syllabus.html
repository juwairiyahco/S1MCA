<H3><u>1.Client/server concepts</u></h3>
What is client-server?
Client-server is a relationship in which one program, the client, requests a service or resource from another program, the server. The label client-server was previously used to distinguish distributed computing by PCs from the monolithic, centralized computing model used by mainframes.

Today, computer transactions in which the server fulfills a request made by a client are very common. The client-server model has become one of the central ideas of network computing. In this context, the client establishes a connection to the server over a LAN or WAN, such as the internet.

Once the server fulfils the client's request, the connection terminates. Because multiple client programs share the services of the same server program, a special server called a daemon might activate to await client requests.n the early days of the internet, most network traffic traveled through what is known as north-south traffic. This is when data moves between remote clients that request web content and data center servers that provide the content. Today, with the maturity of virtualization and cloud computing, network traffic is more likely to flow server-to-server -- a pattern known as east-west traffic.
